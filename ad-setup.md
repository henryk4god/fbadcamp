🎯 Pro Tips for Beginners

Starting Structure

```
1 Campaign
├── 3 Ad Sets (Different audiences)
│   ├── 3 Ads (Different creatives)
│   ├── 3 Ads
│   └── 3 Ads
├── 3 Ad Sets
└── 3 Ad Sets
```

Budget Strategy

· Start with ABO for testing (equal budget distribution)
· Switch to CBO for scaling winners (automatic optimization)

---

⚖️ CBO vs. ABO: Detailed Comparison

Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)

Budget set at campaign level

· Facebook automatically distributes budget across best-performing ad sets
· Best for: Scaling, efficiency, less management

Example:

```
Campaign Budget: $100/day
├── Ad Set 1: $70 (Top performer)
├── Ad Set 2: $20 (Moderate performer)
└── Ad Set 3: $10 (Low performer)
```

Pros Cons
Efficient budget use May starve some ad sets
Ideal for scaling Less control over distribution
Less manual work Not ideal for equal testing

---

Ad Set Budget Optimization (ABO)

Budget set at ad set level

· You control exact budget for each audience
· Best for: Testing, control, fair comparisons

Example:

```
Campaign
├── Ad Set 1: $20/day
├── Ad Set 2: $20/day
└── Ad Set 3: $20/day
```

Pros Cons
Full control Less flexible for scaling
Fair testing More manual management
Equal delivery May miss optimization opportunities
