📊 Budget Strategy: CBO vs ABO Explained

Option 1: 
CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization)

How it works:
You set ONE budget at campaign level → Facebook distributes it automatically

Example:

```
Total Budget: $100/day
│
├── Ad Set 1: Gets $70 (Best performer)
├── Ad Set 2: Gets $20 (Medium performer)
└── Ad Set 3: Gets $10 (Lowest performer)
```

✅ Best for: Scaling successful campaigns

❌ Not ideal for: Initial testing phase

---

Option 2:
ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization)

How it works:
You set SEPARATE budgets for each ad set

Example:

```
Campaign
│
├── Ad Set 1: $20/day
├── Ad Set 2: $20/day
└── Ad Set 3: $20/day
```

✅ Best for: Testing new audiences


❌ Not ideal for: Scaling winners
